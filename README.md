# Player Stats
Player Stats is a Minecraft plugin developed by Skidaux to log Player data into MySQL/MariaDB databases. 
Logged data includes:
- UUIDs
- Usernames
- First join date
- Last logout date
- Time played 
- Player kills
- Player deaths
- Mob kills
- Blocks Walked/Placed/Mined

Players Stats is made for my own usecase as a need to log certain player data, Player Stats is still being worked on and will continue to be updated. There are some current issues that aren't resolved as shown in the issues tab.
- Contributions to this project would greatly be appreciated
